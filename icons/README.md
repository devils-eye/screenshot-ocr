# Icons for Screenshot OCR Extension

This directory should contain the following icon files:

- `icon-48.png` (48x48 pixels)
- `icon-96.png` (96x96 pixels)
- `icon-128.png` (128x128 pixels)

You can create these icons using any image editor or icon generator. The icons should represent the functionality of the extension, which is capturing screenshots and extracting text using OCR.

Recommended icon design:
- A simple, recognizable design that represents screenshot capture and text extraction
- Use a color scheme that matches the Firefox UI
- Make sure the icon is recognizable even at small sizes
